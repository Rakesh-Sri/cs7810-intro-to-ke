# Midterm Assignment
The midterm assignment is to write an article covering (partially) what has been learned in the course, plus independent research into a particular topic that is related to knowledge engineering (with knowledge graphs).

## Topic List
* [Deploying a Knowledge Graph](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/Deploying_a_Knowledge_Graph)
* [Entailment Regimes](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/Entailment_Regimes)
* [Introduction to Modular Ontologies](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/Introduction_to_Modular_Ontologies)
* [Introduction to Upper Ontologies](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/Introduction_to_Upper_Ontologies)
* [Nanopublications](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/Nanopublications)
* [Property Graphs](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/Property_Graphs)
* [Reification](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/blob/master/curriculum/modules/Reification/Reification.md)
* [What is an ontology?](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/What_is_an_Ontology)
* [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/OWL)
* [Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)](https://github.com/KGConf/open-kg-curriculum/tree/master/curriculum/modules/SWRL)

## Requirements
* Do not make any changes to the `Details` section.
* Add content to the `Content` Section
    * Each person should fill in about 1500 words each (which is approximately three single typed pages at 12pt font). There is some wiggle room here, but don't abuse it. There needs to be thorough treatment of the topic, but without "filler" content to reach a particular set length.
    * Include at least three examples. Where possible, use data examples from [here](https://github.com/KGConf/KGC-knowledge-graph/blob/master/kgc2021.ttl) or [here](https://github.com/KGConf/KGC-knowledge-graph/blob/master/kgc2020.ttl).
* Do not modify the Related KGC Media section.
* Create a new section called `External Media References`.
    * Find at least one video which treats your example. If necessary, include a timestamp to the appropriate section of the video. Brownie points if it is a part of a lecture.
* Include all references used in the article in the `References` section. References should be numbered starting at 1, listed in order of appearance, and otherwise following the IEEE reference style. Ensure that the DOI is included for every reference, where available.
* Add the appropriate names (and if desired, links to github usernames) to the `Contributors` section, alphabetically.
